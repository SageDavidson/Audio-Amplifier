# Audio-Amplifier
The audio-amplifier uses a combination of MOSFETs, BJTs, and operational amplifiers to create a circuit that is capable of amplifying digital signals while minimizing noise from external sources in the circuit. The circuit contains a BJT power amplifer, a two-stage MOSFET amplifier, and instrumentation amplifer, and a power supply module that utilizes a full-bridge rectifier to maintain a steady flow of power to all of the components in the circuit. The result is a circuit that is capable of amplfying  digital signals through a speaker, while attempting to minimize static created in the audio-amplifier.
